# Plat Physics

Simple 3D physics engine for Bevy centered around creating platformers.
The engine is currently geared towards simple axis-aligned collisions like:

* Cuboid to Cuboid
* Cuboid to Slope

Where the lefthand side is the Entity collider, and the righthand side is a terrain piece.
See examples for how to use.
